# H2O-Hackathon-AQI-Prediction

Welcome to the repository for the “Predicting the Air Quality Index of Indian Cities using Machine Learning” competition, where the goal is to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) for major Indian AQI stations for the upcoming 28 days using machine learning techniques.

Air quality monitoring is crucial for our well-being, and this competition utilizes historical daily averages of various air pollutants to build accurate models that can predict the AQI for each station. Our team has extensively analyzed the data and constructed models that we believe will help us achieve our objective.

To navigate the repo:
- All the code for EDA and modeling can be found in the notebooks directory.
- `data` directory contains the data used for training and the model `pkl` files. It also contains the final `submission.csv` file.
- Rest of the notebook contains code for H2O-wave app we built and deployed it on Heroku.
  - `app.py` is the main script to run the wave-app.
  - `components`, `pages`, and `utils` directory contain scripts in a modular fashion to support different tabs/sections in the app.
